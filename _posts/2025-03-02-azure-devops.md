## **What is Azure DevOps for Beginners?**

Here‚Äôs a funny story about how this repository started. My friend Sim asked me one day, *‚ÄúBro, how do you add a project into Azure DevOps?‚Äù*  

Honestly, I had no idea either. I‚Äôd never done it before. So, I spent some time on the weekend figuring it out. Once I got it working, I thought, *‚ÄúThis would‚Äôve been so much easier if there was a simple guide to follow.‚Äù*  

That‚Äôs how this repository was born.  

Whenever I learn something new, I doc it down for myself on a repository. But I also make it publicly availible because someone else might be wondering the same thing. My approach to these docs is simple: **I don‚Äôt try to recreate what‚Äôs already out there.**  

Instead, I look online for the best guides and videos, pick out the exact steps that worked for me and summarize them in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand. No extra fluff, no confusing details,just the basics. That way, it‚Äôs helpful for others and I can always come back to it myself.  

So, if you‚Äôve ever felt stuck with Azure DevOps (like Sim and I did), this repository is here to help. It‚Äôs my way of making things a little easier for everyone.

## **Overview**
